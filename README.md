# PiDoor

Flask app to run on a RPI. Door security app.

Playing around with my PaspberryPi. The app has a web interface that accepts commands in JSON format. It controlls several hardware components. As for now, i have added a servo and a relay module. Additionally it has an attached PIR motion sensor and a light sensor.
